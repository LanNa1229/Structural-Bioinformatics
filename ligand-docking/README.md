# Ligand Docking

This repository contains Python scripts for docking ligand molecules to protein structures using AlphaFold outputs.


## ðŸ§¬ **Purpose**

Perform ligand docking analyses to predict protein-ligand interactions and binding modes based on structural models generated by AlphaFold

## ðŸš© Overview of Scripts
ðŸ“—open_AF3_files_change_name_in_pymol2.py

Use Pymol to automate loading and renaming batch of cif alphafold Structure files (only for multiple seed)

Usage:
change the name of location of structure files 
open pymol - run open_AF3_files_change_name_in_pymol2.py 

ðŸ“—Measure_Distance_Angle2.py

Measure the angle and distance of three atoms in object. Iterate this across multiple actions. 

Usage:
run Measure_Distance_Angle2.py     # loads the function
measure_distance_and_angle()       # performs the measurements
