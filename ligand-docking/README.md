# Ligand Docking

This repository contains Python scripts for docking ligand molecules to protein structures using AlphaFold outputs.


## 🧬 **Purpose**

Perform ligand docking analyses to predict protein-ligand interactions and binding modes based on structural models generated by AlphaFold

## 🚩 Overview of Scripts
open_AF3_files_change_name_in_pymol2.py

Use Pymol to automate loading and renaming batch of cif alphafold Structure files (only for multiple seed)

Usage:
change the name of location of structure files 
open pymol - run open_AF3_files_change_name_in_pymol2.py
